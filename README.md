# No Escape

## 1. Goal

You wake up in an unknown room and have to find an escape by exploring the other rooms and so leave the building . However, in each room you will visit, dangerous enemies will try to kill you, the escape will be difficult. To beat them, you will have access to weapons and/or powers making your character more powerful. 

## 2. Rules

- In order to win, your character have to beat the different rooms to find the final one, and then overcome the Boss to exit the building. 
- You character got a determined life, represented on the screen by 4 hearts. Each time you get hit by an enemy, you will lose half of a heart. If your character doesn't have heart, he dies and the game is over. 
- Each enemies will have different amount of life. To beat them, the character will make some damages, according to the kind of weapon he have or the power he spells. If you kill an enemy, he disapears from the screen definitely. 
- To access another room, you have to deal with all the enemies present in the room in a first time.
- There can be sometimes traps in the rooms (spikes, fires, etc.), causing damages to your character if you get hit or if you run into it.
- The enemies, traps and powerups will be randomly set in the rooms.

## 3. Gameplay

- You have to use the keyboard to play the game, no mouse needed. Arrows are used to make your character move (up, left, right and down).
- The keys W,A,S,D keys are here used to make your character shoot in the four directions (W -> up, A->left, S->down and D->right).
- The spacebar can be used to active the power of the character if he got one.
- Escape key can be used to pause the game and go back to the main menu.

## 4. GameWorld

- The game will be set in a 2D World, with a fix camera set on the top of the character.
- The game doesn't take place in our real world but in an imaginary world (existence of powers, monsters as enemies, etc.).
